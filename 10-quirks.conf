# synaptics resolution and axis dimensions are not representative of the
# actual device dimensions, partially because what the kernel exports as
# axis range is the what "fingers of typical size are used on TouchPads
# mounted in typical bezel" produce (synaptics interfacing guide, p 23).
# Even with the axis ranges corrected to what (my) touchpad actually
# produces, the values are even further off, essentially stopping Y
# movement if the server takes resolution into account.
# So for the sake of my sanity, disable synaptics axis resolution by default
# so the server can take the resolution from good devices and use that
# for adjusting movement
