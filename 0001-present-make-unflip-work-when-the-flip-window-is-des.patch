Subject: [PATCH] present: Copy unflip contents back to the Screen Pixmap

As we unflip after the flip Window no longer passes the pixel ownership
test for the full Screen Pixmap, we can no longer utilize that Window to
copy the contents back to the backing pixmap. To first flip means that
the Window was originally backed by the Screen Pixmap and wholly covered
the Pixmap, thus we need to copy the last frame contents to the Screen
Pixmap when the flip chain is complete.
